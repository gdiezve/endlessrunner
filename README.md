# Clean the Oceans! (Endless runner game)

This is a simple endless runner game, designed for mobile devices, where the player will need to clean the ocean by collecting all bottles. But, be careful! It's not going to be easy with all those sharks wandering around...

The project was developed using Unity and C#. Sprites created using Aseprite.

## How to play

Right now the game is only available by running it from Unity editor; you can connect your device using the *Unity Remote* app.
